A program by Logan Hanson

Wow, someone actually downloaded this thing and bothered to read this. Thanks, I guess. This is a super simple python script that takes a user input and "translates" it to brainrot speak, by replacing some words with different ones. I know that's vague, but take it for a whirl and you'll find out what I mean pretty quick. When I say this program is simple, I mean it. As funny(?) as it would be to spend a lot of time polishing this up and making it a lot more functional, I doubt I'll go back to it. At the time of this writing, I am a 20-year-old college junior studying computer engineering, and I hammered this out in maybe an hour to give me maybe an hour of chuckles. Maybe it'll bring some joy to you too, if your brain is as rotted as mine is. If you've read this far, have fun with this little thing. Feel free to use any of the code I wrote (I doubt it'll be much use to anyone but whatever), but if you do I'd like to request that you credit me somewhere. Other than that, have a good one.
